**Relationship Explanations**

1. **Clients to Bookings (1:N - One-to-Many)**
   - **One Client** can make **Many Bookings**.
   - **One Booking** is associated with **One Client**.
   - **Key Relationship**: `Clients.client_id` = `Bookings.client_id` (FK)

2. **Bookings to Events (1:N - One-to-Many)**
   - **One Event** can have **Many Bookings**.
   - **One Booking** is for **One Event**.
   - **Key Relationship**: `Events.event_id` = `Bookings.event_id` (FK)

3. **Bookings to Payments (1:N - One-to-Many)**
   - **One Booking** can have **Many Payments** (e.g., installments).
   - **One Payment** is associated with **One Booking**.
   - **Key Relationship**: `Bookings.booking_id` = `Payments.booking_id` (FK)

**Summary**

- A client can have multiple bookings.
- An event can have multiple bookings.
- A booking is always for one client and one event.
- A booking can have multiple payments (though not explicitly stated in the initial scenario, this allows for flexibility like partial payments).

This design aims to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity by ensuring each piece of information is stored in one place and one place only, making it easier to maintain and update.
