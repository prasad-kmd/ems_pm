# Scenario 3: Event Management System

- Design of an **event management system** is created for an event management company.
This system is designed to streamline the process of scheduling events, managing client
bookings, and keeping track of upcoming events. By organizing key elements such as
**events**, **clients**, and **bookings**, the system enables the company to operate more efficiently
and provide a better experience for both clients and staff.

- One of the primary functions of the system is to manage information about **events**. Each
event scheduled by the company is uniquely identified and recorded with relevant details
such as the **name of the event**, the **date** it will take place, and the **venue** where it will be
held. These details are crucial for ensuring that the company can organize and coordinate
events effectively, avoiding scheduling conflicts and ensuring that all logistical aspects are
properly managed.
- In addition to handling event details, the system is designed to manage **client information**.
Each client who books an event with the company is also recorded in the system with a
unique identifier. The system stores essential client details such as the **client's name**,
**contact information**, and **email**. This information allows the company to maintain a
record of its clients, making it easy to contact them for updates, promotions, or follow-ups
regarding their event bookings.
- The system also handles **bookings** by linking clients to the events they have booked. When
a client schedules an event, the system records the **date** of the booking and links the clientâ€™s
details to the specific event. This ensures that the company can track which clients have
booked which events, making it easy to retrieve booking information, follow up with clients,
and manage multiple events simultaneously. The ability to track bookings is essential for
avoiding double bookings, maintaining smooth communication with clients, and ensuring
that all client preferences and requirements are met.
- The **use cases** supported by this system are integral to its operation. For instance, the
system allows the company to **schedule new events**, ensuring that every event is properly
logged and that important details are recorded in one central location. Another key use case
is the ability to **record client bookings for an event**, allowing the company to manage its
client interactions efficiently. Finally, the system can generate a **list of upcoming events** for
a specific client, enabling the company to keep its clients informed about the events they
have booked.
